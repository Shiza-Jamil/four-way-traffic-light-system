# Four-Way-Traffic-Light-System
## Introduction
A four-way traffic light system designed to regulate vehicle movement at intersections using 555 timers, decade counters (IC 4017), and logic gates. It ensures smooth traffic flow and minimizes congestion by systematically controlling red, yellow, and green signals.

## Features

Automated signal control for four-way intersections.

Sequential light transitions using 555 Timer and Decade Counter.

Simulation & PCB Design for real-world implementation.

Optimized timing mechanism for efficient traffic management.
